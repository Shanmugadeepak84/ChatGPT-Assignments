1.Explain the purpose of the Python code provided. 
The code provided:
i)Loads a pre-trained GPT-2 language model (gpt2-medium) from Hugging Face.
ii)Tokenizes a text prompt.
iii)Uses the model to generate new text based on that prompt.
iv)Decodes and prints the generated text.
Although the comment says “ChatGPT,” GPT-2 is not ChatGPT — it's an older transformer model trained for next-token prediction. But the logic is similar: a prompt goes in, and the model produces a continuation.
2.How does it utilize ChatGPT for text generation, and what is the significance of the parameters used in the model.generate() function?
i)How the Code Uses GPT-2 for Text Generation
The code follows these steps:
Step 1 — Load model + tokenizer
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2-medium")
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2-medium")
The tokenizer converts text → tokens.
The model predicts the next token repeatedly to generate text.
Step 2 — Prepare the prompt
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
This converts your prompt into PyTorch tensors.
Step 3 — Generate new text
outputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=200, num_return_sequences=1, temperature=0.7)
This is where the actual text generation happens.
Step 4 — Decode the output
generated_story = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
The generated tokens are converted back to readable text.
3. Significance of Parameters in model.generate()
Let’s break down the parameters:
max_length=200
Sets the maximum number of tokens in the generated sequence.
Includes:
prompt tokens
plus the generated tokens
If your prompt is 20 tokens, the model will generate up to 180 new tokens.
num_return_sequences=1
Specifies how many different generated outputs you want as variations.
If set to 5, the model would produce five different stories for the same prompt.
temperature=0.7
This controls creativity and randomness.
Low (0.1–0.5) → deterministic, focused, less creative
Medium (0.7) → balanced creativity
High (1.0–1.5) → very creative, but more errors and chaos
Temperature changes the probability distribution of next-token sampling.
