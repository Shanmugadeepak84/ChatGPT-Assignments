1.Explain how the provided Python code generates social media posts using ChatGPT. 
i)Load model + tokenizer
GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2-medium") loads the GPT-2 language model (weights).
GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(...) converts text ↔ token IDs the model understands.
ii)Seed prompt
post_input = "Exciting news! ..." is the prompt that seeds generation. The model conditions on this text to predict what comes next.
Tokenize the prompt
tokenizer(post_input, return_tensors="pt") → token IDs in a PyTorch tensor.
iii)Sampling / generation
model.generate(inputs.input_ids, max_length=150, num_return_sequences=1, temperature=0.9) produces a continuation.
Internally the model predicts one token at a time, sampling from the probability distribution over the vocabulary (temperature scales randomness).
iv)Decode
tokenizer.decode(...) converts the token sequence back to human text.
iv)Result
The output is the original prompt + the model’s continuation — a candidate social post.


2.What are the key considerations for using ChatGPT in content creation for social media engagement?
Strategic / creative
i)Brand voice consistency: define style (tone, words to avoid/always use). Use few-shot examples or system prompts to enforce voice.
ii)Audience targeting: adapt wording for platform (Twitter/X vs LinkedIn vs Instagram) — lengths, emoji use, formality differ.
iii)A/B testing: generate multiple variants and test which performs better (CTR, likes, shares).
iv)Multimodal pairing: text often must match an image/video — coordinate captions with visuals.
Quality & reliability
i)Hallucination risk: models can state incorrect “facts” (dates, specs). Don’t let them invent details about product features, pricing, or availability without verification.
ii)Factual grounding: when factual claims are required, either (a) post-process outputs to verify facts, or (b) use retrieval/RAG to ground claims in source documents.
iii)Prompt engineering: small prompt changes drastically affect outputs. Provide examples, desired length, style markers.
Safety, legal & compliance
i)Moderation & harmful outputs: filter outputs for hate speech, harassment, disallowed content. Use automated filters + human review for risky domains.
ii)Copyright & originality: LLMs may produce text similar to training data. Avoid verbatim copyrighted text; run plagiarism checks for commercial campaigns if needed.
Regulatory compliance: disclosures, required claims (e.g., medical, financial) must be accurate and meet local law — don’t rely solely on LLMs.
iii)Privacy: avoid exposing private user data in prompts. If you personalize posts, keep sensitive attributes out of prompt text or handle them securely.
Operational & cost
i)Throughput & latency: for high-volume social accounts you need batching, caching, and rate limits management.
ii)Cost: ChatGPT API usage (if used) has per-token cost; generate and filter efficiently.
iii)Versioning & reproducibility: record model, prompt, and parameters used for each post (so you can audit or reproduce).
Measurement & iteration
i)Metrics: track impressions, CTR, engagement rate, conversions. Use these to refine prompt templates and tone.
ii)Human-in-the-loop: always include editorial review for public posts — ideally a short approval workflow.
